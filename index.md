# About me

I'm a machine learning researcher and engineer. I'm broadly interested in probabilistic machine learning, generative models, bayesian statistics, unsupervised and self-supervised learning and inductive priors. 

I'm currently a PostDoc in the [REAL](https://real.itu.dk/) group at the IT University of Copenhagen working with [Sebastian Risi](http://sebastianrisi.com/). Before joining ITU I did my PhD at the [Cognitive Systems](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/english/research/research-sections/cogsys) group at the Technical University of Denmark with [Ole Winther](https://olewinther.github.io/). Prior to that I was a Staff Engineer and Machine Learning Team lead at [Tradeshift](https://tradeshift.com/).
