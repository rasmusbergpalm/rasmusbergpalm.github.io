# About me

I'm a machine learning researcher and engineer. I'm broadly interested in probabilistic machine learning, generative models, bayesian statistics, unsupervised and self-supervised learning and inductive priors. 

I'm currently a PostDoc in the [REAL](https://real.itu.dk/) group at the IT University of Copenhagen working with [Sebastian Risi](http://sebastianrisi.com/). Before joining ITU I did my PhD at the [Cognitive Systems](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/english/research/research-sections/cogsys) group at the Technical University of Denmark with [Ole Winther](https://olewinther.github.io/). Prior to that I was a Staff Engineer and Machine Learning Team lead at [Tradeshift](https://tradeshift.com/).

## Software

I often create software libraries and tools and I love publishing them as open source. It lets me write clean code, think about abstractions and interfaces and ship working software to users, which I enjoy.

- [nanograd](https://github.com/rasmusbergpalm/nanograd) - The simplest and smallest possible library for autograd. Great for teaching.
- [shapeguard](https://github.com/rasmusbergpalm/shapeguard) - A tiny library, which allows you to very succinctly assert the expected shapes of tensors in a dynamic, einsum inspired way. A great tool for avoiding bugs.
- [EvoStrat](https://github.com/rasmusbergpalm/evostrat) - A library that makes Evolutionary Strategies (ES) simple to use. It has a flexible and natural interface for ES that cleanly separates the environment, the reinforcement learning agent, the population distribution and the optimization, which allows you to use the standard pytorch `nn.Modules` for policy networks and `torch.optim` optimizers for optimization.
- [pymc3-quap](https://github.com/rasmusbergpalm/pymc3-quap) A quadratic approximation package for PyMC3.
- [pytorch-lgssm](https://github.com/rasmusbergpalm/pytorch-lgssm) A clean Linear Gaussian State Space Model for pytorch, which supports sampling and inference using the Kalman filtering algorithm.
- [Blayze](https://github.com/Tradeshift/blayze) A very fast and efficient *Bayesian* Naive Bayes classifier which perfectly incorporates new information in an online learning setting and support both Gaussian and Categorical/Multinomial features.
- [DeepLearnToolbox](https://github.com/rasmusbergpalm/DeepLearnToolbox) - A now deprecated Matlab toolbox for Deep Learning. I was unwise enough to do my Masters on Deep Learning in Matlab, which didn't have any support for it, so I made a library for MLPs, CNNs, DBN, etc, implementing everything from the ground up, including the gradients, backprop, etc. It became quite popular. I quickly moved on to Python though (yay autograd!), and deprecated it.

## Teaching

I thoroughly enjoy teaching. It challenges me to understand things at a much deeper level, and I find it very rewarding.
